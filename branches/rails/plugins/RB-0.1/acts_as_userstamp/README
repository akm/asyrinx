ActsAsUserstamp
===============

acts_as_userstamp plugin extends userstamp plugin.

= Installing

1. Create your Rails application, set up your databases, grab the Userstamp plugin, and install them.

2. Install LoginEngine plugin by using script/plugin install. Or install AuthGenerator by using gem and generate code.

3. Install the ActsAsUserstamp into your vendor/plugins directory


= Usage

1. Add "acts_as_userstamp" in the class that is used as user. if you use LoginEngine or UserEngine, copy $RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins/login_engine/app/models/user.rb or vendor/plugins/user_engine/app/models/user.rb to $RAILS_ROOT/app/models at first.
   Then modify $RAILS_ROOT/app/models/user.rb like this:

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	  include LoginEngine::AuthenticatedUser
	  include UserEngine::AuthorizedUser
	  
	  acts_as_userstamp
	  
	  # Returns the full name of this user.
	  def fullname
	    "#{self.firstname} #{self.lastname}"
	  end
	end   

2. Add "include UserstampController" to ApplicationController like this:

	class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
	  include LoginEngine
	  include UserEngine
	  
	  include UserstampController
	  
	  helper :user
	  model :user
	
	  before_filter :authorize_action
	end

That's all! You don't need to write belongs_to for each created_by and updated_by. They will be declared automatically.
